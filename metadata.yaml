description: '""I was born a Victorian; and sympathise not a little with the serious
  Victorian Spirit."" In this engaging and extremely personal account G K Chesterton
  expounds his views on Victorian literature. Many of his opinions reflect the conventions
  of the age; however of the Victorian novel he refreshingly comments ""it is an art
  in which women are quite beyond controversy"". Equally uncompromising about poets
  and poetry he does not hesitate to call Tennyson ""a provincial Virgil"". This book
  is an important landmark in our understanding of an age which produced some of Britain''s
  most wi.'
